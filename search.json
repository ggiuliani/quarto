    "text": "Why Living Earth matters?\nLand cover — the physical and biological cover on Earth’s surface such as vegetation types, water bodies, bare soil, or built environments — is a fundamental indicator of environmental state and change. Routine, high-quality land cover information is essential for tracking global and national progress toward environmental goals, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, most existing Earth Observation data (e.g., analysis-ready data from satellites) do not, by themselves, provide standardized land cover products at national scales. Different methods, semantics, and classifications across countries make it difficult to compare or benchmark progress. Living Earth addresses that gap.",

Living Earth implements a fully operational version of FAO LCCS that is:\n\nOptimised for Earth Observation data: It has been adapted to work with multiple satellite sources and national EO infrastructures.\nFlexible yet consistent: Modifications have been made to environmental descriptors and classification hierarchies to ensure logic, scalability, and applicability even with limited data inputs.\nOpen-source and FAIR-compliant: The software is public and designed to follow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data principles to encourage broad adoption. This implementation allows Living Earth to generate globally comparable land cover maps that can be used in policy, research, and sustainable land management.",

These descriptors feed into the LCCS hierarchy to produce detailed land cover classifications that are:\n\nScalable in space and time, enabling repeatable mapping workflows.\nApplicable at national and continental scales, with demonstrated implementations in countries such as Australia and Wales.\nCapable of supporting change detection, allowing assessment of land cover dynamics over years or decades.",
